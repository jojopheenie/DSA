/*321 - Knapsack Problem 0/1
Given a set of items where each item has a weight and a value. And given a knapsack with max weight capacity, determine the maximum value that can be placed into the knapsack without going over the capacity.

Input: An integer array of weights
       An integer array of values
           (The ith item has weights[i] and values[i])
       Integer value of the max weight capacity of the knapsack
Output: Integer of maximum total value
Example
Input:
  weights = [10, 20, 30]
  values =  [60, 100, 120]
  capacity = 50

Output: 220
Knapsack

Constraints
                      Intermediate    Advanced
Time Complexity:         O(2^N)        O(KN)
Aux Space Complexity:    O(N)          O(K)
K is the capacity of the knapsack, N is the number of items

Once you add an item to the knapsack, you can't add it again (no replacement)

Solution
Utilize recursion for the intermediate solution.

Use dynamic programming w/ memoization of the recursive solution or use tabulation

Advanced Tabulation Approach:
The inner loop iterates from 0 to the knapsack capacity and we try to determine the maximum value at each incremental capacity. If adding the current item results in a higher value, we update our max value at that capacity.

Detailed Pseudocode for Tabulation Approach:
Instantiate an array called finalMax with a length equal to one plus the capacity
Loop through the number of items
a) Inside this first loop, make a copy of finalMax called tempMax
b) Create an inner loop and increment a variable cap from 0 to the input capacity
c) If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current cap,
d) Check to see if the value at tempMax[cap - weight] plus the value of the current item is greater value than what is currently in tempMax[cap].
e) If greater, replace the value at tempMax[cap]
After performing both loops, the finalMax should contain the max values obtainable for each capacity level. Since we only care about the max value at our input capacity, return finalMax[capacity].

function knapsack(weights, values, capacity) {
  var finalMax = new Int32Array(capacity + 1); // create a new array of 0â€™s
  for(var i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
    var weight = weights[i];
    var value = values[i];
    var tempMax = finalMax.slice(); // make a copy of the finalMax array
    for(var cap = 0; cap <= capacity; cap++) {
      if(cap - weight >= 0) {
        tempMax[cap] = Math.max(tempMax[cap], finalMax[cap - weight] + value);
      }
    }
    finalMax = tempMax;
  }
  return finalMax[capacity];
}

console.log(knapsack([10,20,30], [60,100,120], 50));
